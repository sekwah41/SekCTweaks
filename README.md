My personal little edits to mc.

The mod is modular so you can enable and disable as many of the features as you want. If something cant be changed while running then it will state that in the module.

If you would like to make a suggestion feel free to open an issue here on github but start it with "IDEA:" so that I know it quickly a suggestion rather than a bug report.
